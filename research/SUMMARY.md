## 1. Framework Name & Vision

**Proposed Name: Orchestra**

Orchestra is a Python-first multi-agent orchestration framework that unifies the best patterns from every major framework into a single coherent system. It combines LangGraph's explicit state graphs with CrewAI's developer-friendly agent definitions, AutoGen's distributed actor model, and Swarm's elegant handoff protocol -- while introducing novel innovations no existing framework provides: capability-based agent security, intelligent cost routing, built-in agent testing harnesses, and a zero-infrastructure-to-production progression path.

The vision is to be the framework that "serious builders" choose when CrewAI is too opaque and LangGraph is too verbose. Orchestra targets the developer who needs inspectable, debuggable, production-grade multi-agent workflows without the operational complexity of enterprise platforms or the limitations of educational tools. It ships with built-in observability, durable execution, and the first credible agent IAM system -- all accessible from a single `pip install`.

## 2. What We Take From Each Framework

| Source Framework | Component/Pattern We Adopt | Why | How We Improve It |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LangGraph** | State graph + typed reducers + checkpointing | The architectural debate is settled: explicit state graphs are the most flexible and debuggable orchestration model. Reducers solve concurrent state updates from parallel agents. | Remove the monolithic LangChain dependency. Simplify boilerplate for common patterns. Add dynamic subgraph generation at runtime (LangGraph graphs are static after compile). |
| **LangGraph** | Time-travel debugging via checkpoint replay | Killer debugging feature. Reconstruct state at any point in execution history. | Ship a Rich terminal renderer that visualizes the trace tree in real-time during development -- no external infrastructure required. |
| **AutoGen** | Actor-model runtime + distributed execution | Only OSS framework with true agent isolation and cross-machine execution. Essential for production scale. | Make it opt-in (asyncio default, Ray backend opt-in). AutoGen forces the actor model on all users; we make it a progressive upgrade. |
| **AutoGen** | Group chat with speaker selection | Natural collaboration pattern for brainstorming and debate workflows. | Add typed message channels (private + group) instead of single shared history. Prevent context window overflow with built-in summarization. |
| **CrewAI** | Role/goal/backstory agent DX + 4-tier memory | Lowest time-to-first-working-agent of any framework. Memory tiers (short-term, long-term, entity, contextual) are the most thoughtful in the ecosystem. | Keep the DX but back it with a graph engine instead of CrewAI's shallow process model. Add Pydantic validation and decorator syntax as alternatives to class-based definition. |
| **CrewAI** | Flow event-driven composition with @listen/@router | Elegant pattern for composing multi-crew workflows with conditional logic. | Integrate flow patterns directly into the graph engine as first-class edge types rather than a separate abstraction layer. |
| **Swarm** | Lightweight handoff via function returns | The most elegant orchestration primitive in the ecosystem. ~300 lines proves the pattern. Widely adopted (copied by AutoGen, LangGraph). | Add persistence, observability, and context preservation to handoffs. Make handoff a first-class graph edge type, not just a function return convention. |
| **MetaGPT** | Structured output protocols per agent role | Constraining agent output format (PRD, system design doc, code, test plan) dramatically reduces hallucination. Forces agents to produce useful artifacts, not just chat messages. | Generalize beyond software development. Define a `StructuredOutput` protocol that any agent role can implement. Validate outputs with Pydantic before passing to next agent. |
| **OpenHands** | Event-sourced execution with typed events | Full audit trail. Every action (tool call, LLM response, handoff, error) is an immutable event. Enables replay, debugging, and compliance. | Combine with LangGraph's reducer-based state: events are the source of truth, current state is a projection. Use SQLite in dev, PostgreSQL in prod. |
| **Semantic Kernel** | Plugin architecture + kernel DI container | Clean separation between AI services and business logic. Multi-language support pattern (Python/C#/Java). SK Process bridges BPM and LLM orchestration. | Adopt Protocol-first plugin design (Python structural subtyping). Avoid SK's verbose boilerplate. Focus on Python-first with TypeScript SDK, not full multi-language parity. |
| **Google ADK** | ParallelAgent / SequentialAgent / LoopAgent primitives | Clean, composable workflow primitives for deterministic sub-flows within agentic workflows. | Make these first-class node types in the graph engine rather than separate agent classes. Enable mixing deterministic workflow nodes with LLM-driven decision nodes. |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Guardrails + managed knowledge bases | Most comprehensive AI safety control plane. Auto-chunking/embedding/indexing for knowledge bases eliminates RAG pipeline boilerplate. | Build a guardrails middleware layer (content filtering, PII detection, cost limits, rate limiting) as composable decorators on agent nodes. Ship a local knowledge base backed by pgvector, not tied to AWS. |
| **Haystack** | Typed-I/O component pipelines + production RAG | Best type safety and strongest RAG implementation. Catches integration errors at compile time. | Integrate typed I/O validation into graph compile step. Adopt component patterns for knowledge base integration. |
| **Temporal** | Durable execution that survives restarts + Saga pattern | Gold standard for long-running workflow reliability. Used by OpenAI for Codex. | Event sourcing + checkpointing for built-in durability. Optional Temporal backend. Saga pattern for rollback. |
| **Mastra** | Native OpenTelemetry + RAG knowledge primitives | OTel built into core from day one. Knowledge bases as first-class nodes. | Mirror: OTel always on. Knowledge base queries as graph nodes. |
| **GraphBit** | Memory safety for infinite loop prevention | Compile-time guarantees against drift and infinite loops. | max_turns guard + compile-time cycle detection + per-node circuit breakers. |
| **n8n** | MCP host + client + 1000+ integrations | Bridges AI agents with legacy BPA. Both consumes and exposes MCP tools. | Orchestra as MCP host, client, AND server. |
| **Salesforce (patterns)** | Atlas topic routing + Conversational/Proactive agent types | Best task routing via capability matching. Proactive agents for event-driven automation. | RouterNode + event-driven triggers (webhook, schedule, data change). |
| **IBM watsonx (patterns)** | React/Plan-Act/Deterministic orchestration styles + nested agents | Three clean orchestration modes covering all use cases. | Built-in pattern constructors: react_loop(), plan_and_execute(), deterministic_pipeline(). |
| **Siemens (patterns)** | Real-time SLO constraints (200-500ms) + Digital Twin integration | Agent systems under strict time budgets. Physics-accurate simulation. | Per-node timeout enforcement + circuit breakers + "Environment Agent" pattern. |

## 3. Novel Innovations (What No Framework Does)

Based on market gap analysis across all research, these are innovations that no existing framework provides:

### 3.1 Capability-Based Agent IAM

No framework has a credible agent identity and access management system. Orchestra introduces:
- **Agent identity**: Each agent has a cryptographic identity with scoped permissions
- **Tool-level ACLs**: Agents can only invoke tools they are explicitly granted access to
- **Secret management**: Agents receive scoped credentials, never raw API keys
- **Audit trail**: Every tool invocation is attributed to an agent identity
- **Blast radius containment**: A compromised agent cannot escalate beyond its permission boundary

This is the clearest enterprise moat. Security is hard to retrofit and easy to differentiate on.

### 3.2 Intelligent Cost Router

No framework optimally routes tasks to cost-appropriate models. Orchestra introduces:
- **Complexity profiling**: Analyze task complexity before LLM dispatch
- **Model tiering**: Automatically route simple tasks to cheap models (GPT-4o-mini, Haiku) and complex reasoning to expensive models (GPT-4o, Opus)
- **Budget enforcement**: Per-workflow and per-agent token budgets with automatic degradation (fall back to cheaper model rather than fail)
- **Cost attribution**: Track costs per agent, per workflow, per user with real-time dashboards

### 3.3 Built-In Agent Testing Framework

No framework has a first-class testing story. "pytest for agents" is an open opportunity. Orchestra introduces:
- **ScriptedLLM**: Deterministic mock that returns pre-defined responses for unit tests (< 30s)
- **SimulatedLLM**: Cheap model with seed + temp=0 for integration tests (< 10 min)
- **FlakyLLM**: Chaos testing mock that simulates timeouts, errors, and partial failures
- **Workflow assertions**: Assert on state at any checkpoint, not just final output
- **Regression suites**: Snapshot agent behavior and detect regressions across model updates

### 3.4 Zero-to-Production Progressive Infrastructure

Every framework forces a choice: zero-infrastructure local dev OR production deployment. Orchestra provides a seamless progression:

| Stage | Storage | Messaging | Observability | Execution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local dev | SQLite + in-memory | asyncio.Queue | Rich console | Single process |
| Team staging | PostgreSQL | NATS JetStream | Jaeger/Grafana | Docker Compose |
| Production | PostgreSQL + Redis | NATS JetStream | OTel + Datadog/Honeycomb | Kubernetes/Ray |

Same code, same graph definitions, same agent definitions. Only configuration changes.

### 3.5 Dynamic Subgraph Generation

LangGraph graphs are static after compilation. No framework supports runtime graph mutation. Orchestra introduces:
- **DynamicNode**: A node that generates new sub-nodes and edges at runtime
- **Plan-and-execute native**: A planner agent decomposes a task into dynamically determined subtasks, each becoming a subgraph node
- **Adaptive workflows**: The graph topology changes based on intermediate results
- **Subgraph composition**: Pre-built subgraphs (research, writing, coding) can be dynamically composed at runtime

### 3.6 Multi-Modal Agent Coordination

No framework provides type-safe coordination of agents producing different output types. Orchestra introduces:
- **Typed agent outputs**: Agents declare their output type (text, code, image, structured data, file)
- **Type-safe edges**: Graph edges validate that producer output types match consumer input types at compile time
- **Multi-modal reducers**: State reducers that handle merging different content types (e.g., merging code blocks, appending images to reports)

### 3.7 Agent Observability with Time-Travel Debugging

While LangGraph has checkpointing and LangSmith has tracing, no framework combines both with a zero-infrastructure developer experience. Orchestra introduces:
- **Built-in trace tree**: Rich terminal rendering of the full execution trace during development
- **Time-travel**: Reconstruct and inspect state at any checkpoint, modify it, and resume
- **Cost waterfall**: Visualize token usage and cost per agent per turn in the terminal
- **No external services required**: Works out of the box with `pip install orchestra`

---

## 4. Core Architecture

### 4.1 Agent Definition Model (Hybrid)

Three definition styles, all producing the same internal `AgentSpec`:

```python
# Style 1: Class-based (CrewAI-inspired, production use)
class ResearchAgent(Agent):
    role = "Senior Research Analyst"
    goal = "Find accurate, sourced information"
    model = "gpt-4o"
    tools = [web_search, document_reader]
    output_type = ResearchReport  # Pydantic model

# Style 2: Decorator-based (Pythonic, rapid prototyping)
@agent(name="researcher", model="gpt-4o", tools=[web_search])
async def research(query: str) -> ResearchReport:
    """You are a senior research analyst. Find accurate information and cite sources."""

# Style 3: Config-based (YAML, no-code platforms)
# agents/researcher.yaml
```

### 4.2 Orchestration Engine

Graph-based core that can express any orchestration pattern:

```
WorkflowGraph
  |-- add_node(id, AgentNode | FunctionNode | DynamicNode | SubgraphNode)
  |-- add_edge(from, to)                    # Sequential
  |-- add_conditional_edge(from, condition)  # Branching
  |-- add_handoff(from, to, condition)       # Swarm-style transfer
  |-- add_parallel([nodes], join_strategy)   # ADK-style fan-out
  |-- add_loop(nodes, exit_condition)        # ADK-style iteration
  |-- compile() -> CompiledGraph
```

The compile step validates the graph (unreachable nodes, type mismatches, cycle detection with max_turns guard) and returns a `CompiledGraph` that can run on either the asyncio executor (default) or the Ray executor (distributed).

### 4.3 State Management (Event-Sourced + Reducer-Based)

Dual model:
- **Reducer-based state** (LangGraph pattern): Typed state with explicit merge semantics for parallel agent fan-in. Pydantic models with `Annotated` reducer functions.
- **Event sourcing** (OpenHands pattern): All state transitions written as immutable events. Current state is a projection over the event log. Enables time-travel debugging, audit trails, and workflow resumability.

### 4.4 Communication Model

Three tiers:
1. **State-mediated** (default): Agents read/write shared typed state. Simple, debuggable, sufficient for 80% of cases.
2. **Typed messages + handoff**: Swarm-style handoff with typed message payloads for conversational routing.
3. **Pub/sub**: NATS JetStream for distributed async workflows where agents need to react to events without tight coupling.

### 4.5 Memory System (Multi-Tier)

Adapted from CrewAI's four-tier model with storage flexibility:
1. **Working memory**: Active context window (in-memory)
2. **Short-term memory**: Current session conversation history (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
3. **Long-term memory**: Cross-session semantic memory (pgvector)
4. **Entity memory**: Structured facts about people, projects, concepts (PostgreSQL)

### 4.6 Tool Integration (MCP-First + Registry)

- **MCP client**: First-class integration with MCP servers for standardized tool access
- **Function-calling**: Direct Python function registration with auto-schema generation
- **Tool registry**: Centralized registry with permission checks, rate limiting, timeout, and audit logging
- **Sandboxed execution**: Docker-based code execution for agent-generated code

### 4.7 Observability (Built-In)

- **OpenTelemetry**: Traces, metrics, logs with vendor-neutral export
- **Rich console renderer**: Real-time trace tree in terminal during development
- **Structured logging**: structlog with JSON in prod, human-readable in dev
- **Cost tracking**: Per-agent, per-workflow token usage and cost attribution

### 4.8 Security Model (Capability-Based Agent IAM)

- **Agent identity**: Each agent has scoped permissions
- **Tool ACLs**: Agents can only invoke tools they are granted access to
- **Guardrails middleware**: Content filtering, PII detection, cost limits as composable decorators
- **Secret management**: Agents receive scoped credentials via the execution context

## 6. Differentiation Matrix

| Dimension | Orchestra (Ours) | LangGraph | AutoGen | CrewAI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent definition** | Hybrid (class + decorator + config) | Function nodes | Typed agent classes | Pydantic class (role/goal) |
| **Orchestration model** | Graph with dynamic subgraphs | Static compiled graph | Actor + group chat | Sequential/hierarchical process |
| **State management** | Event-sourced + reducers | Reducer-based TypedDict | Conversation history | Task output chaining |

| **Zero-infrastructure dev** | Yes (SQLite + asyncio + console) | Partial (needs checkpointer) | Partial (needs runtime) | Yes |
| **Learning curve** | Medium (progressive complexity) | High (graph + LCEL) | High (actor model) | Low (but hits ceiling) |
| **Dynamic workflows** | DynamicNode subgraph generation | Static after compile | Dynamic via group chat | Rigid process types |

---

## 7. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope creep from combining too many patterns** | HIGH | HIGH | Ruthless prioritization. Ship graph engine + agent definition + basic observability first. Every other feature is a later phase. The graph engine IS the product; everything else is progressive enhancement. |
| **Graph engine becomes LangGraph clone** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Differentiate on dynamic subgraph generation, zero-infrastructure DX, and built-in testing. If it is just LangGraph without LangChain, it has no reason to exist. |
| **Agent IAM adds too much friction** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Make security opt-in with sensible defaults. In dev mode, all agents have all permissions. In prod mode, require explicit grants. Never force security on prototyping workflows. |
| **asyncio complexity alienates contributors** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Provide sync wrappers for all public APIs. Extensive documentation with "cookbook" examples. Use anyio for async compatibility. |
| **LLM API non-determinism breaks testing** | HIGH | MEDIUM | ScriptedLLM for unit tests (fully deterministic). SimulatedLLM with seed+temp=0 for integration tests. Never depend on LLM output in CI. |
| **Ecosystem fragmentation** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Adopt MCP for tools instead of building a proprietary connector library. Focus differentiation on orchestration, not tool count. |
| **Community adoption against LangGraph/CrewAI incumbents** | HIGH | HIGH | Target the gap between them: more debuggable than CrewAI, less verbose than LangGraph. Lead with developer experience and the testing story -- both are unserved. |
| **Event sourcing storage growth** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Implement snapshotting (periodic state projections that allow event pruning). TTL-based cleanup for non-critical workflows. |
| **Ray overhead for simple use cases** | LOW | LOW | Ray is purely opt-in. The asyncio executor covers 90% of use cases with zero additional infrastructure. |
| **Irreconcilable tension: simplicity vs. flexibility** | HIGH | HIGH | See feasibility section below. |

---

## 8. Verdict: Is This Feasible?

**Yes, but with critical caveats.**

### What Works Together (No Tension)

The following combinations are architecturally harmonious:

1. **Graph engine + reducer state + event sourcing**: These are naturally complementary. The graph defines topology, reducers define merge semantics, events provide the audit trail. LangGraph already proves graphs + reducers work. Adding event sourcing is an implementation detail of the persistence layer.

2. **Handoff protocol + graph edges**: Swarm-style handoffs map directly to conditional edges in a state graph. This is not a combination problem; it is a specialization of the graph model.

3. **MCP tools + function calling + registry**: MCP tools are discovered via the registry, converted to function-calling schemas, and executed with registry-level ACLs. Clean layering.

4. **asyncio default + Ray opt-in**: The `AgentExecutor` Protocol pattern cleanly separates execution strategy from agent definition. This is a well-proven approach (Temporal uses it).

5. **Zero-infra dev + production deployment**: SQLite-to-PostgreSQL and in-memory-to-Redis are standard progressive infrastructure patterns with no architectural conflict.

### What Creates Real Tension

1. **Simplicity (CrewAI DX) vs. Flexibility (LangGraph graphs)**: This is the fundamental tension. CrewAI is simple because it hides the graph. LangGraph is flexible because it exposes the graph. Orchestra must provide both without making either feel like a second-class citizen. The mitigation is **progressive complexity**: simple patterns (sequential, handoff) should be expressible in 10 lines; complex patterns (dynamic subgraphs, parallel fan-out with conditional join) should be expressible without escape hatches. This is achievable but requires exceptional API design.

2. **Event sourcing overhead vs. performance**: Writing every state transition as an immutable event adds I/O overhead. For simple workflows, this is negligible. For high-throughput workflows with many agents, it could become a bottleneck. The mitigation is **configurable event granularity**: full events in dev/debug, coarse-grained events in production, opt-out for performance-critical paths.

3. **Agent IAM vs. developer velocity**: Security inherently adds friction. If every agent needs explicit tool grants, onboarding becomes tedious. The mitigation is **dev mode defaults**: in development, all agents have all permissions. Security constraints only activate in production mode or when explicitly configured.

### Honest Assessment

The proposed framework is **feasible as a phased build**. Attempting to ship all features simultaneously would produce a mediocre version of everything. The critical path is:

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Graph engine + agent definition + reducer state + basic observability + ScriptedLLM testing. This alone is a credible alternative to LangGraph with better DX.

**Phase 2:** Event sourcing + handoff protocol + MCP integration + Rich console tracer. This is where differentiation becomes visible.

**Phase 3:** Cost routing + agent IAM + distributed execution (Ray) + multi-tier memory. This is where enterprise value emerges.

**Phase 4:** Dynamic subgraph generation + multi-modal coordination + NATS distributed messaging. This is the vision realized.

Attempting to build Phase 3-4 features before Phase 1 is rock-solid would be a strategic error. The graph engine and state management are the foundation. Everything else is layered on top.

**Bottom line:** The combination is achievable because the architecture is layered, not monolithic. Each layer (graph, state, communication, tools, security, observability) has clean boundaries. The risk is not architectural incompatibility -- it is scope management and API design quality.

### Compatibility Assessment of New Elements (2026-03-06 Update)

After analyzing 25+ frameworks and selecting ~75 elements, the following compatibility assessment applies:

**Fully Compatible (No Tension):**
- Salesforce routing patterns + graph engine = RouterNode (just a conditional edge)
- IBM orchestration styles + graph engine = built-in pattern constructors (syntactic sugar)
- Haystack typed I/O + graph compile step = compile-time edge type validation
- Bedrock guardrails + middleware pattern = composable decorators (clean layering)
- Temporal durability + event sourcing = same persistence layer, different guarantees
- MCP + A2A + tool registry = three interfaces to the same tool system
- Circuit breakers + kill switches + graph executor = pre-execution checks (clean hooks)
- Anomaly taxonomy + error hierarchy = Python exception classes (zero runtime cost)
- Memory synthesis + multi-tier memory = periodic background job (orthogonal to core)

**Manageable Tension (Requires Careful Design):**
- CrewAI simplicity + LangGraph graph power = progressive complexity API (the core design challenge)
- Event sourcing overhead + real-time SLOs = configurable event granularity (full/coarse/off)
- DID identity + developer velocity = progressive modes (dev/prod/federated)
- SRE Scout/Sniper pattern + latency budgets = Scout must be fast enough (<50ms)
- A2A interop + capability-based security = external agents get scoped sessions

**Not Attempted (Would Create Irreconcilable Tension):**
- We do NOT try to combine AutoGen's forced actor model with simple asyncio default
- We do NOT try to replicate Salesforce's native CRM data access (platform-specific)
- We do NOT try to embed visual builder in core (API-first, visual builders are third-party)
- We do NOT try to match Siemens' physics-level simulation (too domain-specific)
- We do NOT try to replicate IBM's 100+ pre-built enterprise connectors (MCP ecosystem instead)

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor landscape | HIGH | Comprehensive analysis of 15+ frameworks with clear structural observations |
| Tech stack choices | HIGH | Python/asyncio/Pydantic are well-validated choices with clear rationale for each dimension |
| Implementation patterns | MEDIUM-HIGH | Core patterns (graph, reducer, handoff) are well-documented from framework source code. Event sourcing and dynamic subgraphs are less proven in agent contexts. |
| Market gaps | MEDIUM | Gaps are real (agent testing, IAM, cost routing) but market validation requires user research |
| Novel innovations | MEDIUM | Innovations are architecturally sound but unproven in practice. Intelligent cost routing in particular needs prototype validation. |
| Feasibility | MEDIUM | The combination is architecturally coherent but execution risk is high. API design quality will determine success. |

### New Gaps Identified from External Documents

1. **Anomaly detection implementation**: The two-layer anomaly taxonomy (intra-agent vs. inter-agent) from the Technical Selection Report needs concrete detection algorithms. See `architecture-refinements.md` Refinement 1.
2. **DID/VC infrastructure**: Decentralized Identifiers for cross-org agent trust require ledger/registry infrastructure. This is Phase 4 and may need further research.
3. **A2A protocol v0.3 specification**: Need to track Google's evolving A2A spec for compatibility. Current design based on Feb 2026 version.
4. **Cost router validation**: The SRE Scout/Sniper pattern needs prototype validation to confirm cost savings claims (45% reduction cited in research).
5. **Real-time SLO enforcement**: Siemens-style 200-500ms constraints require benchmarking Orchestra's graph execution overhead.

## Implications for Roadmap

### Suggested Phase Structure

**Phase 1: Core Engine (Weeks 1-6)**
- Graph engine (nodes, edges, conditional edges, compile, run)
- Agent definition (class-based + decorator)
- Reducer-based typed state (Pydantic)
- LLM provider protocol + OpenAI/Anthropic adapters
- Basic function-calling tool integration
- ScriptedLLM test harness
- Console logging with structlog

**Rationale:** This is the minimum viable framework. It must be better than LangGraph at the basics (less verbose, better errors, zero dependencies beyond core) or there is no reason to exist.

**Pitfalls to avoid:** Over-engineering the graph engine. Do not support dynamic subgraphs yet. Do not add event sourcing yet. Get the static graph + reducers right first.

**Research needed:** No -- these are well-documented patterns from LangGraph source code.

**Phase 2: Differentiation (Weeks 7-12)**
- Event-sourced persistence (SQLite dev / PostgreSQL prod)
- Checkpoint-based HITL (interrupt/resume)
- Time-travel debugging
- Rich console trace renderer
- Handoff protocol as first-class edge type
- MCP client integration
- Tool registry with basic ACLs

**Rationale:** This is where Orchestra stops being "LangGraph lite" and becomes something new. Event sourcing + time-travel + Rich console is a developer experience no other framework offers.

**Pitfalls to avoid:** Event sourcing storage growth. Implement snapshotting from day one.

**Research needed:** MCP integration patterns may need phase-level research.

**Phase 3: Production Readiness (Weeks 13-18)**
- FastAPI server + SSE streaming
- OpenTelemetry tracing + metrics
- Redis hot cache integration
- Multi-tier memory system (short-term, long-term, entity)
- SimulatedLLM + FlakyLLM test harnesses
- Cost tracking and attribution
- Guardrails middleware (content filtering, PII, cost limits)

**Rationale:** This phase makes Orchestra deployable in production. Memory, observability, and guardrails are enterprise table stakes.

**Pitfalls to avoid:** Building a full LangSmith clone. Focus on OTel export to existing backends, not a proprietary observability UI.

**Research needed:** Multi-tier memory implementation patterns. pgvector scaling characteristics.

**Phase 4: Enterprise & Scale (Weeks 19-26)**
- Intelligent cost router (model complexity profiling + auto-routing)
- Capability-based agent IAM
- Ray distributed executor
- NATS JetStream distributed messaging
- Dynamic subgraph generation (DynamicNode)
- TypeScript client SDK
- YAML/config-based agent definition

**Rationale:** Enterprise features that create a durable competitive moat. Agent IAM and cost routing are the most defensible differentiators.

**Pitfalls to avoid:** Premature distributed systems complexity. Ray and NATS must remain purely opt-in.

**Research needed:** Yes -- agent IAM design, cost routing algorithms, and Ray integration patterns all need dedicated research.

### Research Flags

| Phase | Research Needed? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 (Core Engine) | NO | Well-documented patterns from LangGraph/Swarm source |
| Phase 2 (Differentiation) | PARTIAL | MCP integration and event sourcing for agents need validation |
| Phase 3 (Production) | PARTIAL | Multi-tier memory and pgvector scaling need research |
| Phase 4 (Enterprise) | YES | Agent IAM, cost routing, and Ray integration are novel territory |
